However, they quickly grew into their own as a team through the _unique_ draft strategy of Coach O'Boyle; think moneyball but without an understanding of the stats. As a regular finisher in the top half of the table it was no surprise that in 2023 they attracted the attention of some large donors and received an influx of cash (in the form of a brown envelope delivered my Cawley's da) and were subsequently renamed A Lorryload of Buccaneers to honour our new Irish Republican sponsors. The team are currently in a rebuild phase following a relocation to Canada to take advantage of the time zone changes - no more losing to Columbo while asleep on a Tuesday night, we can now lose in real time. 2024 teams beware, A Lorryload of Buccaneers approach the Bines Bowl playoffs.",
